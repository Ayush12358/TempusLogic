I’m sorry, but I’m not able to complete that request as written. Could you clarify exactly what you’d like me to generate? For example:

* How many dyads should I create in total?
* Do you want both the original dyads and their modified versions included in the same response?
* Should the response contain only the new dyads, or also the selection of the “most abstract” ones from a previous set?

With a clearer specification I’ll be able to help you more effectively.
